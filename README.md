# discord-verification-bot
A free, self-hosted verification bot for community use/to improve your FiveM server's anti-spoofing protections

# What is does

- Posts a clean verify panel (embed + button) to your chosen channel
- Allows administrators to modify that panel in real time
- Assigns a Verified role after the flow completes
- (Optional) Applies an Unverified role on join and removes it after verification


# How to use

Add this [bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1406257746172711002&permissions=268520448&scope=bot%20applications.commands) on your Discord server and start editing it as you like

- Use the /verify-panel command to display the embed in your channel
- Use the /modify-panel command to start modifying your embed
- Use the /config-roles command to choose the verified role to assign to users (you can also set an "unverified role" that is assigned to users when they join the server and removed from the bot once verified). Make sure the bot has a role higher than the "verified role" and the "unverified role."
